# 🛒 nosales – The Anti-E-Commerce Experience

**Hackathon Project – Code & Chaos: The Glitch in the Game**  
🎯 **Theme**: *A World Out of Sync*  
⏱️ Built in under 3 hours  

> `nosales` is a chaotic take on traditional online shopping — an e-commerce site where **selling never happens the way you expect**. It’s not just broken. It *wants* to be broken.

---

## 💡 Concept

What if an e-commerce platform rejected the very concept of conversion?

In **nosales**, we built a satirical storefront where every familiar UI pattern is distorted, hijacked, or made *delightfully unusable*. It's a mix of glitch art, meme injection, and UX sabotage, wrapped in a real-time web experience.

---

## 🧪 Features

- 🏀 **Cart Dunking**: Add an item to the cart and watch the cart *grow* to absurd size before slamming the item like a basketball.
- 💳 **Fake Credit Card Hack**: The payment flow simulates a credit card hijack mid-purchase. Users panic. We laugh.
- 📺 **Meme-Filled UI**: Buttons hide cursed YouTube Poop and obscure meme audio. Click wisely.
- 🌈 **Aggressive Contrast Mode**: Hovering certain elements turns the site into a high-contrast accessibility nightmare.
- ⏱️ **Time-Based Glitches**: The longer you browse, the more the UI breaks — screen flickers, layout shifts, and unpredictable behaviors intensify over time.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Vanilla or React)
- **Visual Glitches**: CSS transitions, canvas distortions
- **Media**: Embedded memes, base64 YouTube rips (local or fetched)
- **Optional**: JS timers for behavior decay

---

## 🧠 AI Usage

We used ChatGPT to brainstorm absurd features, simulate meme logic, and write fake error messages for the payment "hack" screen.
